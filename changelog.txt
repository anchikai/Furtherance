v1.2.2
- Soul of Leah now grants a one-time-use Heartbreak-like effect (since I couldn't get the health cap increase to work). Will grant 2 Broken Hearts and deal fake damage when used, but is also used automatically when you would take fatal damage
- When Caduceus Staff fails to trigger its effect, it will multiply the last chance by x1.7 instead of adding +5%
- Furtherance's items that grant tear effects now have a stacking chance effect, multiplying the base chance of effect to trigger by the number of copies of the item. This can exceed the capped chance.
- Because of this these Items have stacking effects: Ceres?, Juno?, Vesta?, Leah's Lock, Owl's Eye, Saline Spray
- Fixed EID description for Caduceus Staff and Cardiomyopathy being incorrect
- Fixed several of Furtherance's item descriptions being blank when viewed on the item collection screen on the main menu

v1.2.1
- Fixed T. Peter's outline not updating with any changes to their costumes while active
- Added various safety measures to any of Furtherance's effects involved with tracking damage dealt to enemies or effects on enemy death
- Polydipsia now instantly extinguishes fireplaces
- Miriam's Whirlpool now instantly extinguishes fireplaces and rapidly damages poops

v1.2

General Changes
- Added two new settings for Tainted Peter. This is for adjusting the opacity of the outline effect for submerged entities (including T. Peter) when under grid entities and when not.

Gameplay Changes
- The Soul Love Teller baby "Bound Baby" now fires slightly faster, firing 1.76 tears per second compared to the normal 1.36 tears per second
- Love Teller is now compatible with modded characters. If not directly made compatible, will choose a random compatible character to copy relations from for the remainder of the run. Love Teller's EID will reflect if this is the case
- Eve and Judas' Love Teller babies, who activate Whore of Babylon and The Book of Belial respectively, will wait till the next room to allow another activation of their effects
- Fixed The Forgotten and Apollyon Love Teller Babies not having cooldowns and triggering their effects way too often
- T. Peter: Enemies marked as "Parented" to enemies that ignore the one-sided reflection mechanic, such as bosses, also follow said ruling. This makes it easier to fight bosses such as Clutch, not requiring you to submerge Clickety Clacks
- Furtherance's items now respect vanilla damage multipliers

Bug Fixes
- Fixed Polydipsia not being removed when changing from Miriam to another character mid-run
- Fixed the Eden Love Telller baby "Glitch Baby" not having its currently selected Love Teller baby be rerolled if they had rolled into the baby for Cain, Esau, Azazel, or The Forgotten
- Fixed Keys to the Kingdom losing its charges when used inside a devil room when there are no devil deals in the room
- Potentially fixed a crash related to Polydipsia, Tech -1, Miriam's whirlpool, and Rebound Worm when dealing with spawning something at the end of a laser
- Fixed Backspace Key not accounting for Repentance Alt path and Curse of the Labyrinth
- Fixed Backspace Key softlocking the game if used inside Mom's boss room after defeating her
- Fixed Binds of Devotion's Jacob always having their controls assigned to the keyboard
- Fixed Champions becoming invisible when flipped for Tainted Peter after they moved under a grid entity
- Potentially fixed some enemies with T. Peter becoming "pre-submerged" or already inflicted with the Strength status effect and unable to be interacted with
- Fixed infinite loop of spawning tears and lasers with Technology -1 and Lachryphagy

	- XXIV - Charity: 2 -> 8
	- XXIV - Charity?: 2 -> 6
	- XXV - Charity: 2 -> 8
	- XXV - Faith: 2 -> 4
	- XXIV - Faith?: 2 -> 12
	- Ace of Shields: 12 -> 6
- Fixed Tainted Leah's Broken Heart preview and Heart Container preview on the HUD still rendering if you had Curse of the Unknown active
- Updated IsaacSaveManager to v2.3.1. Last update to the save manager accidentally broke any callbacks that would have some sort of effect for floor-specific saves before it was reset on the next floor. This affected Alternate Reality, Epitaph, Palliuim, and Escort Beggar

- Fixed Jar of Manna, Apocalypse, and The Dreidel not giving stat buffs and returning an error

- HudHelper updated to v1.1.4
- Fixed Exsanguination losing its damage up when moving rooms

v1.1.0

I took some time to gather bug reports and evaluate the state of the characters, namely Peter and Tainted Peter. There's still room for improvement but I didn't want to leave this update hanging for too much longer. Thank you everyone for playing the mod!

Gameplay Changes
Peter & Keys to the Kingdom
- Increased stats gained from sparing bosses and enemies
- Removed cap of gaining a maximum of 6 different stats from spared bosses per boss in the room
- Spared bosses now grant 3 random stats (from 2) and minibosses now grant 2 (from 1)
- Removed stats not able to be gained when sparing enemies that spawned from other enemies
- Non-boss enemies spawned from other enemies can no longer grant soul charges
- Adjusted chance of gaining soul charges from non-boss enemies. Now increases with each floor and should be gained less often
- Peter can now gain charges from collecting black/soul heart pickups, even while at full health
- Segmented and splitting bosses should no longer drop charges on death of each segment/piece, instead respecting that each individual boss, upon death of all segments/split parts, should only drop one boss soul charge
- Enemies no longer drop soul charges in rooms where it would grant a holy mantle charge
- Removed penalty for hitting a boss while it is being spared

Tainted Peter & Muddled Cross
- T. Peter: Now has a starting speed of 1.25
- T. Peter: Removed all previous methods of recharging Muddled Cross (room clear, timed recharge in clear room, killing enemies). They are instead gained from submerging 10 enemies, 10th of a charge per enemies. This can be reduced by AAA Battery and 9 Volt
- T. Peter: The extra enemy room flip duration gained from the amount of submerged enemies is capped at a total of 30 seconds. Car Battery allows this to extend up to a full minute
- T. Peter: Enemy room flip no longer instantly flips back upon killing an enemy if there are enemies in the room that are normally available on both ends of the reflection, such as any bosses
- T. Peter: Enemy room flip destroys all projectiles in the room instead of in a small radius around each player
- Non-T.Peter: Muddled Cross is no longer charged across all players and all active slots simultaneously with every kill. They now only charge one Muddled Cross to the player that dealt the killing blow to the enemy.

Other
- Added numerous synergies for Tech IX with other weapon-changing items
- Old Camera's photo pickups spawn Purgatory ghosts on a brief delay rather than all at the same time
- Full heals such as XIX - The Sun and Rainbow Poops no longer bump Heart Renovator's counter to 99. This was unintentional, but now instead add the same amount of red hearts you had before the full heal
- Rotten Apple's Damage Up changed to +1 (from +2)
- Moon Hearts are now compatible with Soul Locket and Immaculate Conception
- Added a Half Moon Heart. These do not spawn naturally and are primarily for interactions with other effects that spawn a half heart variant, such as "0 - The Fool?"
- Keys to the Kingdom, Apocalypse, and The Dreidel have switched to a tears up formula instead of a direct modification of fire delay (though this won't stop it from breaking the cap because the API is awesome like that)
