Jacob's first wife
Starts with Heart Renovator, a flowering representation of Leah's love
Red health can overflow into a heart counter. Turn them into broken hearts and mend them with Heart Renovator to feel a little stronger, or leave them broken to get your tears flowing

One of the twelve apostles of Christianity
Starts with Keys to the Kingdom, a gift from the angels to open the gates of heaven
Use it to spare enemies. Bosses take longer to spare. Has special interactions with angels and in devil rooms!

Moses' sister and the first female Jewish prophetess
Starts with Polydipsisa and Tambourine, overflowing with water and shaking enemies off your tail
Shoot large arcing tears that leave damaging puddles, every 12 shots also leaving a whirlpool. Puddles that touch have their lifetime extended!
Tambourine inflicts knockback to nearby enemies and briefly creates a gigantic puddle to help increase the lifetime of other puddles
